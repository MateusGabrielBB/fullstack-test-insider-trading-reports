# fullstack-test-insider-trading-reports
This is a WIP!

# Future improvements:
- Fix XML parser that causes inconsistencies when linking the number of shares sold and the value per share used in the transaction
- React front end to search insider tradings by company name
- Virtualize the development environment with docker and docker-compose
- Add some kind of cache to avoid repeated requests for no reason, also add a validation of cached data to confirm when new requests need to be made
- Unit and integration tests
- API and project documentation
